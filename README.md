## Tests:
To run the tests, in any environment you are, run:

``` bash
npm run test
```
``` bash
*npm run test:cov*
``` 
will give you the coverage of unit tests. for this project, the only missing one is the *users.service.ts* file.

## important to remember:
to start database open a prompt and type mongosh database(on my case example: mongosh nest)
after installing RabbitMQ, search for RabbitMQService - start on windows search bar to start RabbitMQ
the same process can be done by RabbitMQService - stop to stop RabbitMQ
